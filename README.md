AI Cybersecurity Detection System
An open-source machine learning-based system for detecting anomalies and potential security threats in network logs.
Features

Real-time log processing: Process and analyze log data from various sources
Anomaly detection: Detect unusual patterns using isolation forest algorithm
Alert generation: Create detailed alerts with severity levels
Extensible: Easy to customize for different types of logs and threats

Installation
bashCopy# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-cybersecurity-detector.git
cd ai-cybersecurity-detector

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Basic usage example:
pythonCopyfrom ai_threat_detector import AIThreatDetector

# Initialize the detector
detector = AIThreatDetector()

# Train with your log data
detector.train(your_training_logs)

# Detect threats in new logs
threats = detector.detect(new_logs)

# Generate alerts
alerts = detector.generate_alerts(threats)
Demo
Run the built-in demo to see the system in action:
bashCopypython ai_threat_detector.py
How It Works

Log Processing: The system extracts relevant features from raw log data
Training: An isolation forest model learns what "normal" patterns look like
Detection: New logs are compared against the model to identify anomalies
Alert Generation: Suspicious activities are flagged with appropriate severity levels
